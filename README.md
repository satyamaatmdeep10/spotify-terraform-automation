# spotify-terraform-automation

## Overview

This project utilizes Terraform to automate the creation and management of multiple Spotify playlists for different occasions, such as morning, evening, and party nights. By defining playlists as infrastructure code, Terraform ensures consistency and efficiency in managing them. The automation eliminates the need for manual playlist creation, allowing seamless updates and modifications. Users can specify playlist details such as name, description, and tracklist dynamically through Terraform configurations. This approach enhances scalability and provides a structured way to handle personalized music curation with minimal effort.
